            <h2>Making stuff to break stuff</h2>
            <p>This whole thing i made to mess around with and experiment to my hearts content. My first example is this one specific paragraph tag being insanely long to see what happens when the text overflows in the browser. I'm hoping it automatically forms paragraphs for the texts but lets see. This is my first project of 2025 which is honestly extremely sad but something is better than nothing
                Something I learned after a long time that it is truly nevber too late. Might as well get my portfolio going and hoping to include this project into it.

                I also gotta remember the github that had all the beautiful portfolios and copy one of their fonts for this journal.

            <p>That's pretty much it for now to be honest. I just got back from work and set this thing up so that I can have something to play with before going to bed.</p>
            <p>Maybe I'll update the entry later on in the night if I feel like it. But for now, goodnight world. See you in the morning.</p>
